* In the design phase we used diagrams, recomended by our tutor for our prodict, which we hadn't seen in class. This showed us that you don't have to use every artifact you study, it's better to select the specific artifacts that fit your proyect the most. 

* We knew that in the requirement phase is recommended to focus on the product's priorities and if possible, add extra functionalities. In the first part of the proyect we thought that we had done this right, but in the latter stages we realized that the requirements and priorities we made were not realistic for the time we had available and what we could do.

* At the beginning of the proyect we had the idea that ir was possible to finish the app we wanted to make, but as we moved forward through the different stages we realized that the process of completing a software proyect requires much more than wanting or knowing how to code. There were a lot of concepts and situations that presented to ourselves during the development that we had no idea of and we realized almost at the end of the semester that is was going to be very complicated to achieve our goal with our current knowlegde and abilities. 

* One of the most important lessons we learnt during the development was the role assignment that needed to be adecueate to every team member's 
strengths in order to fully take advantage of our abilities. 

* En cuanto a la adaptación a metodología de scrum, nos sirvió para tener en mente que los avances debían de ser constantes y el aprendizaje progresivo. 
  Fue un cambio de mentalidad radical debido a que no teníamos experiencia en proyecto a mediano/largo plazo pero sin embargo es algo muy enriquecedor para nuestro desarrollo.
