# Alexa Skill Wake on Lan.
## 2nd Increment.
### Summary of the progress in the second increment. 

When we chose our project, an Alexa skill that takes advantage of the Wake On Lan technology of the devices, we started an investigation of what we were going to need to start developing it, taking into account the technologies and software concepts to make a real software project.
Throughout the first delivery there were many discussions about the specification of requirements and the roles that each member would occupy, but an agreement was reached to continue working together.

In this second delivery the tracking of the activities was changed to a calendar that was filled together with the logbook notes. Likewise, there were some changes to the requirements according to the difficulty and need that we found when making the prototype.
