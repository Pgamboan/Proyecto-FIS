### Summary of the progress in the second increment. 

When we chose our project, an Alexa skill that takes advantage of the Wake On Lan technology of the devices, we started an investigation of what we were going to need to start developing it, taking into account the technologies and software concepts to make a real software project.
Throughout the first increment there were many discussions about the specification of requirements and the roles that each member would occupy, but an agreement was reached to continue working together and keep progressing based on the scrum methodology.

In this second increment the tracking of the activities was modified to a calendar that was filled together with the logbook notes. Likewise, there were some changes to the requirements according to the difficulty and needs that we found when making the prototype.

### Redesign of the project requirements.

### Design phase.

In this process we focused on using the information collected in the analysis stage to design the product. Our main task in the design stage is to develop an accurate model or specifications for the product.

#### Deployment diagram.
Description: This diagram show how hardware and software interact with each other to work properly. To a large extent, these diagrams perfectly describe how the software fits into and interacts with a hardware system. Also, they help show which software element is being deployed by a particular type of hardware.
