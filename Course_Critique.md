### What activities were appropriate.
  * The dynamics with which the teams were formed was very good because we experienced for the first time what it is like to choose both teammates and leaders having only as information the resumes that each one had done.
  * Focus on the development process, our limited knowledge to program as such was not an impediment to organize ourselves and live what a development team is.
  * Scrum methodology.
  * Final presentation in English.
### What to improve.
  * Talks with experts.
  * The dynamics in the theoretical classes.
  * Define the delivery dates with enough time in advance.
  * Lack of organization at the time of receiving participations.
### Proposals for activities that promote the acquisition of competencies.
* Encourage a more technical approach of tools related to Software Engineering.
* Dynamics focused on favoring a certain degree of familiarity among the students.
* More interactive classes through activities that encourage student participation.
### How to improve the monitoring of the students' competences.
* Through the use of ICT it is possible to have the adequate follow-up for the acquisition of competences.
