There was a rework of the requeriments based on what the team deemed achievable in the amount of time we had at our disposal and our joint and individual capabilities: We decided that we won't use the Microsoft Azure plataform to host our web app and instead use another host. After carefull consideration we came to the conclusion that the ip address wasn't 100% necessarry to execute the skill, so we decided to remove it's requeriment. Due to lack of necessity, the team decided to scrap the idea of a bot.
